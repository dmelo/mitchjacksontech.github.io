Here you've found an old-school do-it-all-with-a-shoestring-and-superglue developer trying to become accustomed to the new social internet of tech.  I spend time executing projects in new languages with new tools.  Still perl is my true love.

Perhaps I'll do something with this github contraption.
Perhaps not.
